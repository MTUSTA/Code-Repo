# chromedriver-py

downloads and installs the latest chromedriver binary version for automated testing of webapps.  
the installer supports linux, mac and windows operating systems.

this package is maintained by an automated update script on travis.  
if a new chromedriver version is out, this package will automaticly get updated within a day.

## installation

__from pypi__  
```bash
$ pip install chromedriver-py
```

__from github__
```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/breuerfelix/chromedriver-py.git
```

## usage

to use chromedriver just `from chromedriver_py import binary_path`.  
you will get a string variable with the excecutable filepath for your operating system.

## example
```python
from selenium import webdriver
from chromedriver_py import binary_path # this will get you the path variable

driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=binary_path)
driver.get("http://www.python.org")
assert "Python" in driver.title
```

## developer

you can trigger a custom build with a specific version in travis.  
just make a new environment variable in travis settings with the name `VERSION`.  
the key will be your desired version like `2.44`.

for the last step you have to click on settings again and hit `trigger build`.  
this will try to get your desired version and push it to pypi.

__important:__ don't forget to delete the environment variable later on!
