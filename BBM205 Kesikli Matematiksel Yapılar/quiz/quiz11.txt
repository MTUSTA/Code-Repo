1) (3 pts) Suppose that 100 people enter a contest and that different winners are 

selected at random for first, second and third prizes. What is the probability 

that Zeynep wins one of the prizes if she is one of the contestants?

2) (3 pts) What is the probability that a die never shows an even number 

when it is rolled six times?

3) (3 pts) What is the probability that a positive integer not exceeding 100 

selected at random is divisible by 5 or 7?

4) (2 pts each) Two events E1 and E2 are called independent if p(E1∩E2)=p(E1)p(E2).
For each of the following pairs of events, which are the subsets of the set 

of all possible outcomes when a coin is tossed three times, determine 

whether or not they are independent. 

a) E1: the first coin comes up tails; E2: the second coin comes 

up heads. 

b) E1: the first coin comes up tails; E2: two, and not three, heads come 

up in a row.

c) E1: the second coin comes up tails; E2: two, and not three, heads come 

up in a row.

5) (2 pts each) What is the probability of these events when we randomly select 

a permutation of {1,2,…,n} where n≥4?

a) 1 precedes 2.

b) n precedes 1 and n−1 precedes 2.

c) n precedes 1 and n precedes 2.
