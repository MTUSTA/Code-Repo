############ Your code goes here ##################


# A couple of suggestions for starting:

#   1. Do not panic! This assignment is much easier than it seems. Trust me!
#   2. Take a deep breath and start with the simplest tasks first:
#       - read the input files and print them out to see if you are reading them correctly.
#   3. Store the contents of dictionary.txt in a dictionary data structure and try
#      accessing some of its elements.
#   4. Think about how you can use your dictionary to translate the message once you extract it.
#   5. Think about what you need to consider when extracting the message from the jumbled transmission:
#       - How will you check if a line starts with a special character or not?
#       - Try extraxcting relevant lines and printing them to check if you are doing it correctly.
#       - Once you have the relevant lines, think about how you will translate them word-by-word
#         using your dictionary.
#   6. Once you get started, it will get easier. Do one step at a time and check your results at each step.
#   7. Do not try to code everything at once hoping it will work in the end. In most cases, it will not. 
#	   Instead, divide your work into smaller independent parts which you will test separately.

#   I want everyone to try and complete this assignment. Even if it seems too hard for you at first,
#   I want you to get started and do as much as you can. When you get stuck, ask for advice on how to proceed.
#   The most important thing is that you believe that you can do this. If you work on the assignment
#   every day for at least 30 minutes, you will make progress fast. So don't wait until the last week to start.
#   Start now! Try to enjoy solving this to keep yourself motivated. And trust me when I tell you that:
#   YOU CAN DO THIS!
#   You just need to work on it.
#   Good luck! :)
